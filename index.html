            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>This project aims to develop a Natural Language Processing model capable of summarizing Telugu news articles. The model will take a Telugu news article URL as input and output a concise and informative summary of the article content.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>There is a growing demand for consuming news content in regional languages like Telugu. This project seeks to bridge this gap by creating a Telugu news article summarizer. This model will empower Telugu speakers to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Quickly grasp the key points of news articles without having to read the entire piece.</li>
                <li>Stay informed about current events in their native language.</li>
                <li>Enhance their overall engagement with Telugu news media.</li>
                <li>Convenience at fingertips where users can just copy-paste the link and get the summary.</li>
                <li>This is extremely useful for students, professionals, and general readers of Telugu background needing quick news digests.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
            <p>To build a robust Telugu news article summarizer, we used a large corpus of Telugu news articles. This data served as the foundation for training the NLP model. Here's a breakdown of the data collection process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Integration with Labeled Dataset from GitHub:</strong> We incorporated a labeled dataset from GitHub containing Telugu news articles with links, text content, and corresponding human-written summaries. This dataset improves training efficiency and enhances summary quality by providing clear examples of article-summary pairs.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Data Preprocessing and Working</h3>
            <p>Data preprocessing is crucial in transforming raw text into a format suitable for analysis and summarization. Key steps include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup:</strong> Fetch and parse webpage content to extract the main title and body content.</li>
                <li><strong>Tokenizing Text with Indic NLP library:</strong> Use the Telugu language model from Indic NLP library to process the text.</li>
                <li><strong>Sentence Tokenization:</strong> Split the text into individual sentences using the `sentence_tokenize` function from the Indic NLP library.</li>
                <li><strong>Building Word Frequencies:</strong> Record the frequency of each word in the text to determine sentence significance.</li>
                <li><strong>Normalizing Word Frequencies:</strong> Normalize word frequencies by dividing each frequency by the maximum frequency observed.</li>
                <li><strong>Vectorizing Sentences:</strong> Convert sentences into numerical representations using the Bag-of-Words model and transform into a TF-IDF representation.</li>
                <li><strong>Building a Graph and Calculating PageRank Scores:</strong> Construct a graph with sentences as nodes, weighted by similarity (TF-IDF scores), and calculate importance using PageRank.</li>
                <li><strong>Generating the Summary:</strong> Select top-ranked sentences to form the summary based on the original content's length.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Save the trained model and tokenizer to a specified directory.</li>
                <li>Ensure they can be loaded and used for generating summaries on new data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Journey</h2>
            <p>Initially, we considered translating the Telugu text to English, performing the summarization, and then translating the summary back to Telugu. This approach was tempting due to the extensive availability of NLP tools and resources in English, which are often more advanced and well-supported compared to those for Telugu. However, this method has several significant disadvantages.</p>
            <p>First, the translation process can introduce errors and distortions in the text, affecting the accuracy and integrity of the summarization. Each translation step—both to and from English—risks losing nuanced meanings and cultural context inherent in the original Telugu text. Additionally, the double translation process is computationally expensive and time-consuming, which could lead to inefficiencies in processing large volumes of text. Therefore, we decided to directly work with Telugu text, leveraging specific models and resources for Indian languages to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and cultural relevance in our summarizations.</p>
            <p>After showing this approach to our mentor Prof. Nidhi Goyal, we were advised to train a model on an existing dataset of text and summarized text. Doing so would yield more accurate results and summaries. We then utilized a pre-trained model from Hugging Face and trained the model as detailed in the "Model Training" section.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>After implementing and testing our Telugu text summarization model within the Streamlit interface, the results are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Evaluated the effectiveness of the summarizer using diverse web pages with different types of content.</li>
                <li>Assessed how well the summaries encapsulate key information present in the original content.</li>
                <li>Analyzed whether the generated summaries accurately capture main ideas and crucial details from the original text.</li>
            </ul>
